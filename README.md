# Snake-Game
This is a simple Snake game implemented in Java. The game allows players to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating targets to grow longer. The goal is to eat as many targets as possible without colliding with the snake's own body. The snake can be controlled using arrow keys (up, down, left, right). Targets appear randomly on the screen for the snake to eat. After eating a certain number of targets, the size of the targets decreases, making the game more challenging.
